## Project Overview
The Student Management System is a simple console-based application developed using Python.  
It allows users to add student details, view stored records, and exit the system.  
The project follows the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

### 1. Requirement Analysis
The system is required to:
- Add student details (Name, Matric Number, Department)
- Store student records
- Display all stored students
- Exit the program

The system should be simple, user-friendly, and fast.

---

### 2. System Design
- Student data is stored in a list named students
- Each student record is represented as a dictionary
- Main functions used:
  - add_student()  
  - view_students()  
  - main()

The design names match the implementation.

---

### 3. Implementation
The system was implemented using Python and saved as student_management_system.py.  
A menu-driven interface allows user interaction.

---

### 4. Testing
The system was tested by:
- Adding student records
- Viewing stored students
- Handling invalid menu options
- Exiting the program

All tests were successful.

---

### 5. Deployment
The project was deployed by uploading the source code to a public GitHub repository.

---

### 6. Maintenance
Future improvements may include:
- Editing or deleting student records
- Saving data to a file or database
- Adding a graphical user interface (GUI)
